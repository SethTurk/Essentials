Essentials
==========

Not to confuse with Essentials plugin for bukkit or Forge Essentials (AIO mod), this is Essentials Forge Edition, made for Forge Servers in mind for 1.7+ that provides the basic essentials commands that you would normally see on bukkit-like servers. 

Currently this is a WIP and will be unstable at the current time as this is a rewrite of a mod I worked on for 1.5.2.
